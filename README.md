# BTCPay Server Shopify App

This is an app that provides a checkout extension to make it possible for Shopify merchants to accept Bitcoin payments using BTCPay Server.

You can find installation instructions on our official documentation page: [BTCPay Server for Shopify](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Shopify-v2/)

This app is based on the official [Shopify Remix app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix). Other than the original template we have a docker-compose.yml file in place that makes sure nginx and Let's Encrypt companion is deployed and can be used on any cheap VPS.
